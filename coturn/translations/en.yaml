      If no IP(s) specified in the config file or in the command line options,
      then all IPv4 and IPv6 system IPs will be used for listening.


      The special value "host" can be specified here, in which case
      the address being used to contact the default gateway will be
      substituted at run time.

      In that situation, if a -X is used in form "-X <ip>" then that ip will be reported
      as relay IP address of all allocations. This scenario works only in a simple case
      when one single relay address is be used, and no RFC5780 functionality is required.
      That single relay address must be mapped by NAT to the 'external' IP.


      The special value "host" can be specified here, in which case
      the address being used to contact the default gateway will be
      substituted at run time.
  relay-ip:
    name: Relay Address
    description: >
      Relay address (the local IP address that will be used to relay the

      Multiple relay addresses may be used.
      The same IP(s) can be used as both listening IP(s) and relay IP(s).


      The special value "host" can be specified here, in which case
      the address being used to contact the default gateway will be
      substituted at run time.
